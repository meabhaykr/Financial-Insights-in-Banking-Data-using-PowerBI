## Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to provide in-depth financial insights for banking institutions. By analyzing 'Banking Transactions' and 'Customer Account Details' datasets, we aim to help banks make informed decisions about customer relationships, risk assessment, and product offerings.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Standardization**: Removed failed transactions and reformatted datasets for consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Relationships**: Established and optimized data relationships to ensure high data quality.
- **Branch Efficiency Rating System**: Developed a system to rate branch efficiency, enhancing risk assessment and performance metrics.
- **Credit Score Analysis**: Identified high-value transactions and analyzed credit scores for better risk management.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Created an interactive dashboard for comprehensive data visualization and insights.

## Project Goals
- Extract meaningful insights from banking data to support strategic decision-making.
- Improve customer satisfaction through data-driven optimizations in banking services.
- Identify new growth opportunities and predict future account growth using advanced data analysis techniques.

## Datasets Used
1. **Banking Transactions**
2. **Customer Account Details**

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For advanced data analysis and calculations.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: For initial data exploration and understanding.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data quality and consistency.

## Methodology
1. **Data Import and Quality Check**: Imported both datasets into Power BI and checked for data quality issues.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed failed transactions and standardized transaction amounts.
3. **Data Merging**: Combined the datasets for comprehensive analysis.
4. **Advanced Analysis using DAX**: 
   - Analyzed transaction trends over time.
